pdfgrepSIXEL
------------

A tool inspired by pdfgrep that displays not text but pdf pages as results.


Possible future features:
- No duplicate pages
- Highlight text inside pages
(- display numbers next to pages for those operations:)
- Edit a page in an external editor (text or graphical)
- See adjacent pages

"Bugs":
- Only one word is searchable (no space)
- Too many pdf files won't work because of loop with uppercase letters (see code)
